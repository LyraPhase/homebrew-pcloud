# Installing pCloud with Homebrew Cask

Since this recipe was rejected because of the volatile nature of pCloud links (see [homebrew-cask#57634](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/57634)) I try to maintain this myself because it is useful to me and might be for others.

 - Download `pcloud-drive.rb`.
 - Run `brew cask install pcloud-drive.rb`.
 
To uninstall run `brew cask uninstall pcloud-drive.rb`.
