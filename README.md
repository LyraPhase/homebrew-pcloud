# Installing pCloud with Homebrew Cask

Since this recipe was rejected because of the volatile nature of pCloud links (see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/57634) I try to maintain this myself because it is useful to me and might be for others.

 - Download https://gist.github.com/tomgross/bae4f30023272d8c8c0d920b62720c6b#file-pcloud-drive-rb 
 - Run `brew cask install pcloud-drive.rb`
 
To uninstall run `brew cask uninstall pcloud-drive.rb`.
