Install pCloud Drive via Homebrew

Since this recipe was rejected from Homebrew because of the volatile nature of pCloud links (see [homebrew-cask#57634](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/57634)) we will try to maintain this because it is useful to us and might be for others. :smile:

## Installation

First, make sure you have installed [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) and [`homebrew-cask`](http://caskroom.io/) if you haven't yet.

Then, run the following in your command-line:

    brew tap trinitronx/homebrew-pcloud

## Usage

**Note**: For info run:

    brew info --cask pcloud-drive

Once the tap is installed, you can install `pcloud-drive`!

    brew install --cask pcloud-drive

To uninstall run:

    brew uninstall --cask pcloud-drive
